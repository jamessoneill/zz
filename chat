I wanted to check in ahead of the July 9 meeting regarding the updated pod structure. 
I noticed I wasn’t included in the recent pod documentation. I just wanted to make sure I’m not being overlooked and that I’m aligned going forwards.
I understand from a recent conversation with Becky that I’ll no longer be part of the ETD pod, but I haven’t yet to received confirmation on new pod structure / reporting line and where this pod sits.
I've had a meeting to Sandeep and Tobyn on project handover for: ETD Sponsored access , but would like to clarify the above.
Appreciate any clarity you can provide ahead of the meeting.
